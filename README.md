Welcome to Quiz Master, a fun and interactive quiz game built in Python using the Pygame library Streamlit. 

This README will provide you with all the information you need to understand the game's objective, rules, technology stack, and setup instructions.

Game Objective and Rules

The objective of this game is to answer the most questions correctly. Each round will have ten questions that will come from categories and difficulty levels of your choosing. Take your time as you answer the questions. There is no time limit. Above all else, have fun! You have full autonomy over the questions you receive. 
		
Step 1: Select a Category 

You will start the game by selecting the category you want your questions to be randomly generated from. These categories could range from Entertainment to Science. Please select a category that would provide the most enjoyable experience for this round. After the game starts, you can change your category if you desire for each question. 
When a category has been selected, the first question and corresponding answer choices will appear. You will have the opportunity to change your category after previewing a question. 

Step 2: Select the Level of Difficulty

For the best experience, you should select the difficulty level after selecting the category. The first question will default to the easy difficulty level. The levels of difficulty range from Easy to Medium to Hard. Please be sure to pick a level of difficulty that would provide the most enjoyable experience for you. If you change from the default difficulty level, the question will change to reflect the new chosen level. 

Please review the question before you submit your answer. When an answer has been submitted, it will count towards your final score. You will not be able to go back and change the difficulty level or category for any previous question. 

Most importantly, challenge yourself and your friends and have fun! Correct answers will be displayed for every wrong answer. At the end of the game, your score will be revealed. Will you be the next Quiz Master? Play this game and find out!
