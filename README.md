<b> Technology Stack </b>

The Quiz-Master game is developed in Python language and uses ‚ÄúPygame‚Äù as its primary library. Pygame is one of the most popular open-source Python libraries that is primarily used for creating 2-D games and other related applications. It provides a convenient and easy-to-use set of functions and tools for developing games, and it is built on top of the SimpleDirectMedia Layer. Several Pygame packages were used in developing the application, which includes random, time and altair. Random package is used to generate random numbers, which is useful for selecting questions at random. The time package is used to control the flow of the game, like delaying the next question until the specified time or till the user answers the question. Altair package is used to create interactive charts, which are used to display player scores and other information about the game.

There are a few other packages used, such as Streamlit, is used for creating the user interface of the game. It allows for easy web app development with Python. Requests package used for making HTTP requests. JSON library is used for encoding and decoding JSON data. Other general libraries like datetime, pandas, numpy, and plotly are used. 

The modules and functions used in the game development are discussed below:

The code begins with import statements to bring in the necessary libraries and packages.

get_category(): This function fetches all the available quiz categories from the Open Trivia Database API and returns them as a dictionary.

get_question(): Based on the selected category and difficulty, it returns a list of questions.

initialize_session_state(): It initializes the game state, which includes the current question index and player score, using Streamlit‚Äôs session state.

update_score(): This function compares the player's choice with the correct answer and updates the player's score accordingly. If the player's choice matches the correct answer, the score is incremented. Streamlit components like "st.success" and "st.error" are used to provide feedback to the player

UI Setup: The code sets up the user interface using Streamlit. It allows the user to select a quiz category, difficulty level, and provides options to answer questions and navigate through the quiz.

calculate_score(): This function includes most of the functionality of the application. It calculates the player‚Äôs score by comparing their choices with the correct answer and then updates the session. This part has Streamlit‚Äôs UI components for creating the game, such as st.title, st.subheader, st.sidebar, st.radio, and st.button. Inside the function, it compares player_choice with correct_answer and decides whether to increase the player's score or not. The updated player score is stored in Streamlit‚Äôs session state so that it persists across different questions in the game.

Category Selection: A Streamlit select box allows the user to choose from among the various categories that the code has retrieved.

Selection of Difficulty Level: Using a choose box, the user may select between three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard.

Question Fetching: Questions are retrieved from the API based on the chosen category and level of difficulty. The "quiz_questions" list is where these questions are processed and kept.

Question Display: The code controls how questions are shown, letting the player choose their response by pressing a radio button.

Answer Submission: The "calculate_score" function is triggered when the player submits an answer.

Getting Around the Quiz: After submitting an answer, the code shows the next question, allowing players to move around the quiz. The quiz ends and the final score is shown once every question has been answered.

<b> Reflection from the Project </b>

Throughout the course of our project, we made several decisions, some of which turned out to be effective, while others didn't quite hit the mark. Our journey involved various stages, from initial organization and team management to design and project development. Reflecting on this process, we encountered both challenges and successes that taught us valuable lessons.
First, we recognized the importance of breaking our project into manageable segments, each aligning with our individual expertise. This approach allowed us to efficiently allocate tasks and responsibilities. We aimed to maintain clear communication by scheduling weekly meetings to provide updates and address any issues. However, it wasn't always smooth sailing due to our team member‚Äôs differing schedules and commitments. Some of us had different work hours and commitments, making in-person meetings challenging. To overcome this, we heavily relied on digital communication tools like Teams and email to facilitate rescheduling, ensuring everyone was on the same page.

One key decision that worked well for us was choosing GitHub as our collaboration platform. We opted for GitHub because it was a familiar tool to all of us. While our levels of experience with the platform varied, our shared knowledge created a common ground that promoted efficient collaboration. GitHub enabled us to stay updated on each team member's contributions, making it easy to manage the project. To enhance our teamwork and document sharing, we also utilized Google Drive, which proved invaluable as we began crafting our project's readme file. When it came to designing and developing our project, we initially envisioned a setup where players had complete control over the number of questions in each round. However, as we delved deeper into the project and encountered challenges, we realized this might not be the best approach. We still wanted to provide users with autonomy, but we also recognized the importance of delivering a quality product. After discussions and troubleshooting, we made the decision to standardize each round with ten questions. This choice struck a balance between user control and the project's quality. Instead of focusing on the number of questions, we empowered users to choose the difficulty level and category, giving them a sense of ownership over their experience.

Looking back, our journey was marked by its share of successes and setbacks. The challenges of coordinating meetings among a group with varying schedules tested our ability to adapt and rely on digital platforms. While we initially aimed for complete user autonomy in question selection, we learned that sometimes, compromising for the sake of a better project outcome is essential.
One key lesson that emerged from our experience was the value of flexibility and adaptability. In the dynamic world of project development, it's crucial to remain open to change and adjust your approach when necessary. We also learned the importance of leveraging tools and platforms that the team is familiar with to streamline collaboration and ensure a smooth workflow.

Overall, our project's design and development process was a journey of discovery, growth, and adaptation. It demonstrated the significance of effective team communication, embracing familiar tools, and finding a balance between user autonomy and project quality. These lessons will undoubtedly serve us well in future endeavors, as we continue to refine our skills and approaches in the ever-evolving world of project management and development.
